# STICKEREST

## What is Stickerest?

Stickerest is a university project for the exam "Introduction to Database". It wants to represent a website in which artists can draw artworks and sell them or offer them as packs of Whatsapp Stickers, real physical Stickers or just NFTs.

### Type of Users

The platform can have mainly two type of Users:  

- Designers, those who create the digital artwork of the sticker and publish it; 
- Clients, those who use the platform to buy, download these artworks. 

### Sticker packs

The artworks published are called stickers and they are offered in packs. These sticker Packs are offered as 3 different products: pack of WhatsApp digital stickers, downloadable and that can either be free or have a cost chosen by the creator; pack of real physique Stickers; pack of NFTs, for which people can buy each NFT of the pack separately (but not on our platform).

### Shipping & Printing

Clients can buy stickers also as physical packs and they can ask for a shipping at their home or to pick them in a pick-up point. The pick-up points are local printing shops near to them, which are affiliated with STICKEREST. This is wanted to be possible both to for the possibility to receive the product not at home and to enhance the local shops and the small businesses.

## Database

The Database is one of the main parts of this project, since everything was focused on it. There is a detailed [documentation](https://github.com/francescomazzini/Stickerest/blob/main/Database/Stickerest%20Documentation.pdf) in the repository which explains every phases, through which the DB has been designed and realized and there is also the final [translation](https://github.com/francescomazzini/Stickerest/blob/main/Database/stickerestSQL.sql) to SQL, using also PLpgSQL.

## Website

WORK IN PROGRESS. The project was only about the database itself. Nevertheless, I really like the idea and I would like to build the whole platform, as soon as I can.
